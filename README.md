# Blockchain-based-E-Voting

Description:
E-voting system using blockchain works as a step towards creating secure and transparent environment for 
elections where the users will be able to cast their votes only once and will be able to view the total votes casted in the real time 
without having the permission to edit the same after elections get over. The working of block-chains will
ensure the votes are maintained and the systems are not altered by any third party. 
The electronic voting system uses blockchain which is decentralized.
